# Spark_R_modeling
Here are the materiasl I used to lead the OCRUG book club session on modeling & pipeline in Spark R. This repository includes my teaching slides and exercises in modeling with Spark R. The modeling includes supervised learning using decision tree regressor (house_price dataset) and the unsupervised learning includes k-means clustering (iris dataset).
