# Spark_R_modeling
I led the OCRUG book reading session modeling & pipeline in Spark R. This repository includes my teaching slides and exercises in modeling with Spark R. The modeling includes supervised learning using decision tree regressor (house_price dataset) and the unsupervised learning includes k-means clustering (iris dataset).
